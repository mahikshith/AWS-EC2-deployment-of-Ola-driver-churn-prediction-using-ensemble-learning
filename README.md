# OLA driver partner churn prediction using ensemble models : 

## Problem Statement : 

Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the service on the fly or jump to Uber depending on the rates.

As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, Ola is casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

 ## Objective : 

 To help the business to identify / predict whether the cab driving partner will churn to other company or not based on different attributes.

 ## Approach : 

 Bought the data into a proper structure  

 Performed data analysis 

 Tried different Ensemble Machine Learning models , performed hyper-parameter tuning and compared performance metrics of different models.

 Picked the best model

 Made a demo using streamlit for Poc.
